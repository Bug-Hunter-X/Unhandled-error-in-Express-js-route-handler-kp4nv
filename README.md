This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.  This scenario focuses on handling invalid user IDs in a GET request, but the principles apply broadly to various input validation scenarios in Express.js applications.
